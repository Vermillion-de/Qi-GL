## This is Qi's reimplementation of GLUT for visualization of 3d Datasets, our functions mainly about mimic( :) ).
### currently we support functions like
1. mouse/key move/rotate object(vim for rotate, wasd for move), scroll to max/minize 
2. basic key bindings, e.g. esc->quit
3. using texture with stb_image
4. use imgui for interaction
5. work with cmake
### TODO:
1. add light (commonly good for light)
2. reimplement with modern opengl (mainly with the "draw" function)
3. user interfare for chose point with mouse casting.
4. Integral algorithms like meshlab.
