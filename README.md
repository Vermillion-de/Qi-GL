## This is Qi's reimplementation of GLUT for visualization of 3d Datasets, our functions mainly about mimic( :) ).
-> currently we support functions like
1. mouse move object (left / right)
2. orientation(rotation), scroll to max/minize
3. vim (and aswd) keybinding for rotate / move
4. basic key binding, e.g. esc->quit

TODO:
1. add ImGUI
2. add light and texture (commonly good for light)
3. reimplement with modern opengl (mainly with the "draw" function)
4. user interfare for chose point with mouse casting.
5. Integral algorithms like meshlab.
